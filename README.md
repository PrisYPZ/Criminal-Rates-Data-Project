# Criminal-Rates-Data-Project
This project focuses on analyzing crime rates in Baltimore, Maryland,United States by using Python data analysis techniques.
The large datasets contain 30,000 rows including date occurred, area name of the crimes occurred, crime description, criminal status description, victim age, victim sex, Victim descent etc. It can help the relevant departments to understand crime distribution and make safety policies to reduce crime rates in relevant area.

•	Use data cleaning techniques to understand the datasets size and make data analysis preparation via Python tools on Jupyter notebook	

•	Leverage Python data visualization capabilities to analyze crime data to understand the relationship between victim age and victim sex and area in order to find the segments of crime percentage. Tools include Pandas and Matplotlib.

•	Presenting insights for the relationship between victim sex and crime counts to understand if crime rates are closely related to victim sex by using Matplotlib and Python functions

•	Deeply analyze the criminal behaviour through relationship between victim age and criminal counts through building a histogram via matplotlib. The graph shows that victims are mainly in age group between 20 to 40.

•	Provide useful insights to understand if different criminal status affects the number of victims 

•	Building visualization charts to understand the variance of crime counts across different age
